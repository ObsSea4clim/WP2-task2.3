# WP2-task2.3

Files beginning with HCMR contain experimental code for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) with different techniques. File LSTM-CNN3-CNN12.ipynb contains the code for the implementation of LSTM (plus the search of it's hyperparameters), CNN 1D 3 kernel, and CNN 1D 12 kernel, with trainning and testing on Athos satellite data. File LSTM-DifferentWindows folder contains the code for the implementation of LSTM (plus the search of it's hyperparameters) with trainning and testing on Athos satellite data for different window periods.
